"""
A very simple profiling class.  Define some timers and methods
to start and stop them.  A TimerCollection holds a group of
timers.  Nesting of timers is tracked so we can pretty print
the profiling information.

tc = TimerCollection()

a = tc.timer('my timer')

This will add 'my timer' to the list of Timers managed by
the TimerCollection.  Subsequent calls to timer() will
return the same Timer object.

To start the timer:

a.begin()

... and to end it,

a.end()

For best results, the block of code timed should be large
enough to offset the overhead of the timer class method
calls.

tc.report() prints out a summary of the timing.

Warning: At present, no enforcement is done to ensure proper
nesting.
