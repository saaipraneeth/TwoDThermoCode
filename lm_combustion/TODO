This solver will implement a basic low Mach number solver.  We needed
to start with the incompressible solver and:

 -- add density evolution

    o switch constraint to div (beta/rho) grad phi = RHS

    o advect rho

 -- add support for boundary conditions other than periodic

 -- need to modify the MG solver to support coefficients

 -- add a reaction term


Support 2 modes: combustion and atmospheric flows


Problems:

 -- bubble rise (which can be compared to the compressible solver)

 -- flame
