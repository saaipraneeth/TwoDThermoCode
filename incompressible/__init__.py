"""
The pyro solver for incompressible flow.  This implements as second-order
approximate projection method.  The general flow is:

  -- create the limited slopes of u and v (in both directions)

  -- get the advective velocities through a piecewise linear Godunov 
     method

  -- enforce the divergence constraint on the velocities through a 
     projection (the MAC projection)

  -- recompute the interface states using the new advective velocity

  -- update U in time to get the provisional velocity field

  -- project the final velocity to enforce the divergence constraint.

The projections are done using multigrid
