This is a simple list of the improvements we wish to make to pyro.

new solvers:

  -- Burgers equation (viscous and inviscid)

  -- low Mach number hydro (both combustion and atmospheric)

  -- nodal MG solver?

  -- radiation hydro (gray FLD)

  -- mapped grids


infrastructure:

  -- the MG solvers should check that the incoming coefficient arrays
     have the same # of ghost cells -- perhaps the coefficients should
     come in as their own ccdata2d object? or pass in a grid object
     like we do got mg.get_solution()
