-- compressible hydro + gray flux-limited diffusion

   - we'll follow the method in the Castro II paper

   - couple radiation into the hydro as source to Riemann problem

-- use MG solver to solve radiation system

   - the general_MG solver can now handle the form of the
     elliptic equation + do inhomogeneous BCs
