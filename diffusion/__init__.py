"""
The pyro diffusion solver.  This implements second-order implicit 
diffusion using Crank-Nicolson time-differencing.  The resulting 
system is solved using multigrid.  

The general flow is:

   compute the RHS given the current state

   sets up the MG

   solve the system using MG for updated phi

The timestep is computed as:

   CFL* 0.5*dt/dx**2
